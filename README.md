## 🎮 Game Mechanics

Players are dealt number and operation cards each round. They must:
- Arrange cards to create a valid mathematical expression
- Calculate a result that beats the alien's expression
- Defeat all aliens on a planet to progress to the next world

The game features:
- **5 Progressive Worlds**  
  - World 1: Low number addition & subtraction (1–8)  
  - World 2: Higher number addition & subtraction (6–12)  
  - World 3: Low number multiplication & division (1–8)  
  - World 4: Higher number multiplication & division (6–12)  
  - World 5: Factorials & exponents (2–6)
- **Dynamic Difficulty** – Expressions are generated to ensure every round is both winnable and losable  
- **Lives System** – 3 lives per world  
- **Score Tracking** – Points awarded for each alien defeated  
- **Outfit Store** – Customize your character with outfits and cosmetics  
- **Leaderboard** – Compete with other players and track high scores

## 🛠️ Technology

The frontend is built with **TypeScript** and **Konva.js**, using an MVC architecture for a clean separation of game logic, rendering, and user interaction.
